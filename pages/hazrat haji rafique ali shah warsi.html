        <h1>Waqiyat</h1>
        <p>Hazrat Al-Haaj Sufi Dr. Faqeer Rafique Ali Shah Warsi, a renowed Warsi Faqeer residing in the city of Mumbai was born on 01 January 1971 in the house of Hazrat Irfan Ali Siddiqi in a village called Ashrafa, District Bahraich Sharif, Uttar Pradesh. A village where majority of the people are either Hashmi (Sayed) or Siddiqi. Being a descendant of Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddiq Raziallahu Ta'ala Anhu in childhood itself He had great love and affection towards poor and destitute people irrespective of their caste and religion. Often in his childhood He was seen feeding the hungry and helping the poor and elderly people of his village. One afternoon during his childhood a Jain mendicant happen to pass by His house. When Hazrat Rafique Shah Warsi saw him and at once exclaimed  "Oh mendicant, come and eat food". The mendicant with tears in his eyes said "I was hungry from past 3 days and was not allowed to ask for food from anyone, I didn't speak anything regarding my hunger, then how come you came to know that I am hungry?" Hazrat Rafique Ali Shah Warsi smilingly said "Sarkar Waris Pak has informed me one day prior that a Jain mendicant who will pass by your house tomorrow is hungry from past 3 days, offer him food. When I saw you I immediately came to know that you are the person Sarkar Waris Pak had informed me about." The mendicant was astonished by this answer. Every person who came to his house never returned empty handed or empty belly. Now also at his Khanqah Sharif no people leave empty handed irrespective of their caste and religion.</p>
        <p>Apart from helping people, during his childhood he was seldom seen either reading Qur'an Pak and other holy books,  reading stories of Sufiya Kiram, meditating in solitude or spending his time at the shrine of Hazrat Sayed Salar Mas'ood Ghazi Rahmatullah Alaih. He also spent great part of his childhood alone meditating in the cave of Himalayas. He also had great spiritual connection with Hazrat Abbas Ali Shah  Rahmatullah Alaih whose grave is in forest near his house.</p>
        <p>In his youth He was initiated in Warsi silsila by Hazrat Sayed Mashooq Ali Shah Warsi Rahmatullah Alaih (Descendent of Mehboob-E-Ilahi Hazrat Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya's sister and Khanqah-E-Niyazi's Gaddi Nasheen Hazrat Hasni Miya's maternal uncle) who resided in Naintal, Haldwani. However, He received ehram from Hazrat Sayed Masoom Ali Shah Warsi Rahmatullah Alaih who resided in Babagunj near India-Nepal border and was a direct disciple of Sarkar Waris Pak. In fact, Haji Sufi Dr. Faqeer Rafique Ali Shah Warsi is the last Ehramposh Faqeer of Hazrat Sayed Masoom Ali Shah Warsi Rahmatullah Alaih. Both Hazrat Sayed Mashooq Ali Shah Warsi and Hazrat Sayed Masoom Ali Shah Warsi loved Him greatly. He served his Murshid with great love and enthusiast.</p>
        <p>On his trip to Hajj Muhaddis-E-Makkah Hazrat Sayed Muhammad Alvi Sahab (who served as a head Pesh Imam in Masjid-E-Haram Sharif for over 40 years and also a disciple of Hazrat Maulana Ziauddin Madni) hosted a feast for him at his residence in Makka Mukarrama. During rush hour in Haram Sharif the mutawa of Haram Sharif would escort him. In Madina Munavvara, Masjid-E-Nabvi Sharif He was gifted the holy dust of Rauza-E-Rasool by a Sufi Saint of Abul Ulai silsila. Like Sarkar Waris Pak, He would spent his days visiting holy sites and his nights in worship. Many residents of Makkah and Madina were initiated in Warsi silsila at His hands.</p>
        <p>He arrived in Mumbai in late 90's as per the order of Sarkar Waris Pak for spreading the teachings of his Murshid. Many people who were used to alcohol and other drugs and did not use to offer single prayer became his disciples and gave up all their bad habits forever. The people who are initiated into the order by Him are given Zikr-E-Ilahi and are strictly ordered to pray and help those in need.</p>
        <p>There are various people in India, South Africa, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Yemen, Oman, Spain, the USA and the UK who are initiated by him in Warsi silsila and received financial, educational and spiritual support  from Him. The credit of spreading Warsi silsila in the "City of Dreams" Mumbai majorly goes to Him.</p>
        <p>Like Sarkar Waris Pak people of all castes and religions are welcomed in His Khanqah. <br>The biggest Khanqah of Silsila-E-Warisiya in Mumbai is leaded by Him in the best possible manner. Also an independent organization WAFSA (Warsi Foundation of South Africa) which is active in India as well as South Africa is run by Him which aims in helping the poor and the needy, meal distribution, organizing urs of various Auliya Allah and promoting the teachings of Sarkar Waris Pak. </p>
        <p>The personality, knowledge and love of Hazrat Haji Sufi Dr. Faqeer Rafique Ali Shah Warsi has touched many lives and changed them positively and will continue to do the same Insha Allah.</p>
